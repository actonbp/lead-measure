# Documentation Directory

This directory contains documentation, reports, and other research outputs for the leadership measurement embeddings project.

## Directory Structure

- [`quarto/`](quarto/README.md): Quarto documents for reproducible research
  - Analysis reports
  - Visualizations
  - Paper drafts and supplements

## Documentation Goals

The documentation in this directory aims to:
1. Provide reproducible research reports for analyses
2. Generate visualizations for presentations and papers
3. Support the development of academic papers based on project findings
4. Document methodological decisions and their rationales

## Quarto Documents

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is used for creating reproducible scientific and technical documents that combine code, results, and narrative text. These documents:
- Allow integration of Python and R code
- Generate publication-quality figures
- Support various output formats (HTML, PDF, Word)
- Enable transparent reporting of methods and results

## Paper Development

This directory will house drafts and supporting materials for academic papers related to:
- Embedding-based construct validation in leadership research
- Semantic analysis of leadership measures
- Methodological innovations in leadership measurement
- Comparative analysis of traditional vs. embedding-based approaches

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation:
1. Follow consistent formatting styles
2. Ensure all code within documents is reproducible
3. Include citations for methodological decisions
4. Provide clear descriptions of analyses and results

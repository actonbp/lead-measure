# Raw Data Directory

This directory stores original, unmodified leadership measurement scales and related data sources.

## Purpose

The raw data directory serves as a repository for original leadership measure items and scales exactly as they appear in their source. This provides:
- A reference point for the original measurement instruments
- Preservation of original wording and formatting
- Citation information for the original sources

## Expected Contents

- PDF or text files of original published scales
- CSV/Excel files with original survey items
- Documentation of scale properties from original sources
- Any supplementary materials related to the original measures

## Naming Convention

Files should follow a consistent naming pattern:
```
[construct]_[author]_[year].[extension]
```

For example:
- `ethical_leadership_brown_2005.pdf`
- `transformational_leadership_bass_1990.csv`

## Data Sources

Data in this directory may come from:
- Published journal articles
- Books on leadership measurement
- Existing leadership assessment instruments
- Datasets with leadership measurement items

## Adding New Data

1. Maintain original formatting and content

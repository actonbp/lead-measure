    Embedding Analysis Comparison: Big Five vs. Leadership Styles
    ===========================================================
    
    Effect Size Comparison:
    ----------------------
    Big Five Effect Size: 0.1238
    Leadership Effect Size: 0.2581
    
    Intra-Category Distances:
    -----------------------
    Big Five: 0.9821 ± 0.0949
    Leadership: 0.9709 ± 0.0986
    
    Inter-Category Distances:
    -----------------------
    Big Five: 0.9919 ± 0.0588
    Leadership: 0.9908 ± 0.0464
    
    Clustering Metrics:
    -----------------
    Big Five - Adjusted Rand Index: 0.0144
    Leadership - Adjusted Rand Index: -0.0071
    
    Big Five - Adjusted Mutual Information: 0.0251
    Leadership - Adjusted Mutual Information: 0.0224
    
    Clusters Found:
    -------------
    Big Five: 3 clusters (vs. 5 true categories)
    Leadership: 2 clusters (vs. 9 true categories)
    
    Interpretation:
    -------------
    Leadership styles show stronger separation with an effect size difference of 0.1343.
    
    The clustering analysis shows that Big Five categories are more easily distinguished by unsupervised clustering.
    
    Key Findings:
    -----------
    1. TF-IDF vectorization and UMAP visualization reveal substantial overlap between both Big Five 
       traits and leadership styles in semantic space.
       
    2. The effect size between intra-category and inter-category distances is larger for leadership styles (0.2581), suggesting that leadership constructs show more internal cohesion.
    
    3. The semantic space of both domains shows substantial overlap, suggesting that 
       current measurement approaches may not fully capture distinct constructs.
    
    Questions for further analysis:
    ----------------------------
    1. Why are leadership constructs more similar to each other than personality traits?
    2. Which specific leadership constructs show the greatest overlap?
    3. Would a different embedding approach (e.g., fine-tuning with GIST loss) improve the separation?
    4. Are there alternative language-based methods that could better differentiate these constructs?

Holdout Validation Results Summary
==================================

Training Information:
- Model trained on 80% of IPIP data (training split)
- Evaluated on 20% IPIP holdout (novel personality items)
- Evaluated on leadership items (novel leadership items)

IPIP Holdout Performance:
-------------------------
- Number of items: 520
- Number of constructs: 177
- Same construct similarity: 0.3532 ± 0.1742
- Different construct similarity: 0.1860 ± 0.1460
- Cohen's d: 0.733
- Probability of correct ranking: 76.15%

Leadership Performance:
----------------------
- Number of items: 434
- Number of constructs: 11
- Same construct similarity: 0.3295 ± 0.1512
- Different construct similarity: 0.2413 ± 0.1302
- Cohen's d: 0.447
- Probability of correct ranking: 68.43%

Performance Comparison:
----------------------
- IPIP accuracy: 76.15%
- Leadership accuracy: 68.43%
- Difference: 7.72 percentage points

Key Findings:
-------------
1. The model shows similar performance on holdout IPIP vs leadership items
2. Effect size (Cohen's d) for IPIP: 0.733 (medium)
3. Effect size (Cohen's d) for Leadership: 0.447 (small)

Interpretation:
--------------
The performance difference is minimal, suggesting the original findings may have been influenced by training bias.

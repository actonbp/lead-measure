# Visualizations Directory (Updated June 4, 2025)

This directory contains all analysis outputs, plots, and visualizations from the leadership measurement project.

## üéØ Most Important Results

### Primary Evidence (Used in Manuscript)

## üìÅ Directory Organization

### Current Validation Results (June 2025)
- `construct_holdout_validation/` - Final validated results with construct-level holdout
- `enhanced_statistical_comparison/` - Statistical significance testing
- `holdout_validation/` - Initial holdout validation approach

### Historical Results (For Reference)

- `mnrl_evaluation_*/` - Various model evaluation approaches
- `trained_ipip_*/` - Different training configurations
- `big_five_*/` - Initial Big Five personality analysis
- `leadership_styles_*/` - Early leadership-only analysis

## üîç Understanding the Visualizations

### t-SNE Plots
- **Good separation**: Distinct, non-overlapping clusters (see IPIP constructs)
- **Poor separation**: Overlapping, mixed clusters (see leadership constructs)
- **Color coding**: Each color represents a different construct

### Statistical Plots
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly ranked same-construct pairs
- **Cohen's d**: Effect size (>0.8 is large, 0.5-0.8 is medium, <0.5 is small)
- **Error bars**: 95% confidence intervals

### Distance Distribution Plots
- Show distribution of cosine similarities
- Separate curves for same-construct vs different-construct pairs
- Greater separation = better construct distinctiveness

## üìà Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | IPIP Personality | Leadership | Difference |
|--------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Accuracy | 87.4% | 62.9% | 24.5 pp |
| Cohen's d | 1.116 (Large) | 0.368 (Small) | 0.748 |
| t-statistic | 43.49 | - | p < 0.001 |

## üé® Visualization Tools Used

- **t-SNE**: For dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For statistical plots and distributions
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations (HTML files)

## üìù Notes for Future Analysis

1. **Replication**: All visualizations can be regenerated using scripts in `scripts/ivan_analysis/`
2. **Raw data**: Embedding vectors and distances stored in `.pkl` files in `processed/`
3. **Customization**: Modify visualization scripts to highlight different aspects

## üöÄ Quick Reference for Paper Writing

When citing visualizations in manuscripts:
- Use `top5_coherent_constructs_tsne.png` as primary visual evidence
- Reference exact statistics from JSON files for numerical claims
- Note that all results use construct-level holdout validation (no data leakage)

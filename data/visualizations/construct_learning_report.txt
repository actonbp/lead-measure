    Construct Space Learning Model Report
    ====================================
    
    Model details:
    - Base model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    - GIST loss training on IPIP constructs
    - Transfer to leadership styles
    
    IPIP Construct Identification Performance:
    -----------------------------------------
    - Test Accuracy: 0.1383
    - Number of constructs: 243  # Subtract 'accuracy', 'macro avg', 'weighted avg'
    - Effect size between construct categories: 0.8161
    
    Leadership Construct Identification Performance:
    ----------------------------------------------
    - Test Accuracy: 0.0000
    - Number of constructs: 90
    - Effect size between construct categories: 0.3415
    
    Comparative Analysis:
    -------------------
    The model performed BETTER on IPIP constructs compared to leadership constructs.
    
    Effect size comparison shows that IPIP constructs are more distinct in the embedding space.
    
    Key Findings:
    -----------
    1. The model was able to learn construct spaces from IPIP data with 13.8% accuracy.
    
    2. When applied to leadership styles, the model achieved 0.0% accuracy in predicting the correct construct.
    
    3. The smaller effect size for leadership constructs (0.3415 vs. 0.8161) 
    suggests that leadership constructs overlap more compared to personality constructs.
    
    4. UMAP visualizations confirm these findings, showing less distinct clustering for leadership constructs.
    
    Conclusion:
    ----------
    This analysis supports the hypothesis that leadership constructs have substantial semantic overlap and may not represent truly distinct constructs.
    
    The model's ability to more effectively distinguish personality constructs compared to leadership constructs suggests that 
    leadership measurement may benefit from reconsidering its construct boundaries and potentially developing more distinctive measurement approaches.

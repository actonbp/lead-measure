Holdout Validation Results Summary
==================================

Training Information:
- Model trained on 80% of IPIP data (training split)
- Evaluated on 20% IPIP holdout (novel personality items)
- Evaluated on leadership items (novel leadership items)

IPIP Holdout Performance:
-------------------------
- Number of items: 427
- Number of constructs: 50
- Same construct similarity: 0.4242 ± 0.1844
- Different construct similarity: 0.1887 ± 0.1376
- Cohen's d: 1.116
- Probability of correct ranking: 87.35%

Leadership Performance:
----------------------
- Number of items: 434
- Number of constructs: 11
- Same construct similarity: 0.3481 ± 0.1479
- Different construct similarity: 0.2839 ± 0.1228
- Cohen's d: 0.368
- Probability of correct ranking: 62.90%

Performance Comparison:
----------------------
- IPIP accuracy: 87.35%
- Leadership accuracy: 62.90%
- Difference: 24.45 percentage points

Key Findings:
-------------
1. The model shows different performance on holdout IPIP vs leadership items
2. Effect size (Cohen's d) for IPIP: 1.116 (large)
3. Effect size (Cohen's d) for Leadership: 0.368 (small)

Interpretation:
--------------
This validates that leadership constructs have significantly more semantic overlap than personality constructs, even when controlling for training bias.

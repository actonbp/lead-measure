# Manuscript Update Summary - June 2025

## Overview
The manuscript has been updated to reflect the most recent validated findings from June 4, 2025, using Ivan Hernandez's construct-level holdout validation methodology.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. **Abstract**
✅ Already had correct statistics:
- IPIP: 87.4% accuracy (Cohen's d = 1.116)
- Leadership: 62.9% accuracy (Cohen's d = 0.368)
- Performance gap: 24.5 percentage points (p < 2.22e-16)

### 2. **Method Section**
✅ Accurate description of:
- Construct-level holdout: 80/20 split (197 training, 50 holdout constructs)
- Sample sizes: 427 IPIP holdout items vs 434 leadership items
- Hardware: Mac Studio M1 with 64GB unified memory
- Training time: 3-4 hours with 4x speed improvement

### 3. **Results Section**
✅ Already had correct primary statistics
✅ Updated **Table 2** (Holdout Validation Approaches):
- Changed from "236 constructs" to "197 constructs (80%)"
- Changed from "10 held-out constructs" to "50 held-out constructs (20%)"

✅ Updated **Table 3** (Performance Comparison):
- IPIP: 87.4% [85.2, 89.6]
- Leadership: 62.9% [58.7, 67.1]
- Difference: 24.5 pp [18.7, 30.0]
- Cohen's d: 1.116 vs 0.368 (difference: 0.748)

✅ Added new section "Construct Coherence Visualization" with Figure 1 reference

### 4. **Figure Integration**
✅ Added Figure 1 caption in new Figures section:
- Describes t-SNE visualization of top 5 coherent constructs
- Notes tight clustering for IPIP vs dispersed for leadership
- Includes technical details about visualization method

✅ Copied key visualization to manuscript/figures/:
- `top5_coherent_constructs_tsne.png`

## Validation Statistics (June 4, 2025)

### IPIP Construct Holdout
- **Accuracy**: 87.4%
- **Same-construct similarity**: 0.4242 ± 0.1844
- **Different-construct similarity**: 0.1887 ± 0.1376
- **t-statistic**: 23.06 (p = 6.12e-77)
- **Cohen's d**: 1.116 (Large effect)

### Leadership
- **Accuracy**: 62.9%
- **Same-construct similarity**: 0.3481 ± 0.1479
- **Different-construct similarity**: 0.2839 ± 0.1228
- **t-statistic**: 7.66 (p = 1.22e-13)
- **Cohen's d**: 0.368 (Small-medium effect)

### Statistical Comparison
- **Performance gap**: 24.5 percentage points
- **Statistical test**: t(853.99) = 43.49, p < 2.22e-16
- **Effect size difference**: 0.748 (Large practical difference)

## Methodological Notes

### Ivan's Enhanced Approach
- **TSDAE pre-training**: 3 epochs with BGE-M3 model
- **GIST loss training**: 5 phases with batch size 96
- **Triple randomization**: Pair, order, and batch randomization
- **Construct-level holdout**: Most stringent validation approach

### Parameter Differences from Ivan's Original
- Learning rate: 2e-5 (vs Ivan's 2e-6)
- Epochs: 50 (vs Ivan's 60)
- Batch size: 96 (vs Ivan's 256)
- Result: 87.4% (vs Ivan's 92.97%)

## Next Steps

1. **Review compiled document**: Check `leadership_measurement_paper.docx`
2. **Verify figure placement**: Ensure Figure 1 appears correctly
3. **Update author information**: Replace placeholder emails/ORCIDs
4. **Final proofreading**: Check for consistency and clarity
5. **Prepare for submission**: Format according to target journal requirements

## Key Finding
The validated results provide robust empirical evidence that leadership constructs show significantly less semantic distinctiveness (62.9%) compared to personality constructs (87.4%), supporting concerns about construct proliferation in leadership research.

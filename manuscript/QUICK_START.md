## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"quarto: command not found"**
- Install Quarto from https://quarto.org/

### **"R: command not found"**  
- Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/

### **Wrong formatting in Word**
- Make sure you use `--to apaquarto-docx` (NOT just `--to docx`)

### **Tables not at end**
- This is correct! APA format moves tables to end automatically

### **Citations show as [?]**
- Check your `references.bib` file has the correct citation keys

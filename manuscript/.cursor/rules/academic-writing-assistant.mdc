# AI Academic Writing Assistant

## Project Purpose
This repository provides a complete template for AI-assisted academic writing that produces publication-quality APA 7th edition documents. The system combines modern document preparation (Quarto) with intelligent writing assistance (AI) to streamline the academic writing process.

## Core Functionality

### APA Document Generation
- **Primary Goal**: Generate properly formatted APA documents from minimal setup
- **Key Command**: `quarto render academic_paper.qmd --to apaquarto-docx`
- **Output**: Professional Word document with APA 7th edition formatting
- **Success Criteria**: Tables at end, proper citations, title page, running head

### Template Structure
- `academic_paper.qmd` - Main manuscript template with sample content
- `references.bib` - Bibliography in BibTeX format with sample citations
- `_extensions/wjschne/apaquarto/` - APA formatting system (REQUIRED)

## Academic Writing Standards

### APA 7th Edition Requirements
- **Title Page**: Running head, author information, institutional affiliation
- **Abstract**: 150-250 words with keywords
- **Main Text**: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusion
- **Citations**: In-text format [@author2024] and complete reference list
- **Tables/Figures**: Moved to end with "INSERT TABLE X ABOUT HERE" placeholders

### Content Guidelines
- **Academic Tone**: Formal, objective, evidence-based writing
- **Structure**: Clear section hierarchy with appropriate headings
- **Citations**: Support all claims with appropriate references
- **Methods**: Detailed enough for replication
- **Results**: Objective presentation of findings
- **Discussion**: Interpretation, implications, limitations

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Writing Support Priorities
1. **APA Compliance**: Ensure all formatting follows APA 7th edition
2. **Academic Quality**: Maintain scholarly tone and rigor
3. **Citation Accuracy**: Proper in-text citations and bibliography entries
4. **Structural Coherence**: Logical flow and organization
5. **Content Development**: Assist with academic argumentation

### Common Academic Tasks
- Generate section content following academic conventions
- Create proper APA citations and bibliography entries
- Develop tables and figures with appropriate formatting
- Review for academic tone and clarity
- Suggest improvements for argument structure
- Ensure method descriptions are complete and replicable

### Content Creation Patterns
```
Introduction: Literature review → Gap identification → Research questions
Method: Participants → Materials → Procedure → Analysis
Results: Descriptive → Inferential → Tables/Figures
Discussion: Interpretation → Implications → Limitations → Future directions
```

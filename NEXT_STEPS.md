# üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (June 2, 2025)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Complete**: All scripts, environment, and data ready
- ‚úÖ **Step 1 Complete**: 41,723 randomized pairs generated
- ‚ùå **Step 2 Failed**: Training stopped due to GPU memory limitation
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next Action**: Run on machine with 16GB+ GPU memory

## What to Do Next

### Option 1: Quick Commands (Recommended)
```bash
source leadmeasure_env/bin/activate

# For Mac Studio M1/M2 with 64GB (OPTIMIZED - 4x faster):
make ivan-step2-mac-studio

# For other machines:
make ivan-step2    # The critical training step

# Then continue with:
make ivan-step3    # Analysis and visualization
make ivan-step4    # Baseline comparison
```

### Option 2: Step-by-Step with Validation
```bash
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --check
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 2
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 3
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 4
```

### Option 3: Complete Workflow
```bash
./scripts/run_ivan_analysis.sh
```

## Expected Timeline
- **Step 2**: 30-60 minutes (training with TSDAE + GIST)
- **Step 3**: 5 minutes (IPIP analysis and visualization)
- **Step 4**: 5 minutes (baseline comparison)

## Expected Results
- **99.43%** probability of correct same-construct ranking
- **Cohen's d = 2.487** (massive effect size compared to baseline)
- Clear visual separation of constructs in t-SNE space

## Files Ready
All implementation complete in `scripts/ivan_analysis/`:
- Environment: `leadmeasure_env/` with all dependencies
- Data: `data/processed/ipip_pairs_randomized.jsonl` (41,723 pairs)
- Scripts: Complete Ivan analysis pipeline
- Documentation: `scripts/ivan_analysis/SETUP.md`

## After Completion
1. Apply enhanced model to leadership data
2. Compare with previous findings (expect higher confidence in semantic overlap)
3. Generate comprehensive final report

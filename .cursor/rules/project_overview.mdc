## Project Goal and Approach

This project determined if leadership measurement constructs are semantically distinct or redundant compared to established personality constructs (IPIP).

**VALIDATED METHODOLOGY (Ivan's Enhanced Pipeline):**
1. **Triple-randomized pair generation**: Eliminates ordering bias in contrastive learning
2. **TSDAE pre-training + GIST loss fine-tuning**: Domain adaptation with BGE-M3 model  
3. **Rigorous holdout validation**: 80/20 construct-level splits prevent training bias
4. **Statistical evaluation**: Cosine similarity analysis with Cohen's d effect sizes

**FINAL VALIDATED RESULTS:**
- **IPIP holdout constructs**: 87.4% separation accuracy (Cohen's d = 1.116)
- **Leadership constructs**: 62.9% separation accuracy (Cohen's d = 0.368)
- **Statistical significance**: t(853.99) = 43.49, p < 2.22e-16
- **Research conclusion**: Leadership constructs show significant semantic overlap

## Project Goal and Approach

This project aims to determine if leadership measurement constructs are semantically distinct or redundant compared to established personality constructs (like IPIP).

The primary method involves:
1.  Generating text embeddings for survey items using Sentence Transformer models (either fine-tuned local models or external API models).
2.  Fine-tuning local models using contrastive loss functions (e.g., GISTEmbedLoss) to enhance construct separation in the embedding space.
3.  Evaluating the separability using metrics like 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) accuracy and distance analysis (comparing intra- vs. inter-construct distances).

The main script for running these experiments is [analyses/embedding_experiment_pipeline.py](mdc:analyses/embedding_experiment_pipeline.py). Key input data includes personality items from [data/ipip.csv](mdc:data/ipip.csv) and leadership items likely from [data/Measures_text_long.csv](mdc:data/Measures_text_long.csv).

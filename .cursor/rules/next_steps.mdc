# IVAN'S ENHANCED ANALYSIS - NEXT STEPS

## What Ivan's Approach Achieves:
- **99.43%** accuracy in construct separation (vs 81.66% baseline)
- **Cohen's d = 2.487** (massive effect size)
- Triple randomization eliminates ordering bias
- TSDAE pre-training for domain adaptation
- BGE-M3 model optimized for clustering

## Current State:
- Step 1 ✅ DONE: 41,723 randomized pairs generated
- Step 2 ❌ FAILED: Training needs bigger GPU (16GB+)
- Steps 3-4 ⏳ WAITING: Analysis and comparison ready

## Immediate Commands:
```bash
# Quick status check
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --status

# Run the failed training step
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 2

# Or use Make commands
make ivan-step2
make ivan-step3  
make ivan-step4
```

## After Completion:
1. Apply enhanced model to leadership data
2. Compare results with previous findings
3. Generate comprehensive report with improved confidence

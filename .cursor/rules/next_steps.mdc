# MANUSCRIPT DEVELOPMENT - NEXT STEPS

## âœ… ANALYSIS COMPLETE - VALIDATED RESULTS:
- **IPIP Holdout**: 87.4% accuracy (Cohen's d = 1.116) 
- **Leadership**: 62.9% accuracy (Cohen's d = 0.368)
- **Statistical significance**: p < 2.22e-16
- **Key finding**: Leadership constructs significantly more semantically overlapping

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY FOCUS: MANUSCRIPT COMPLETION

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Update manuscript statistics** with validated findings
2. **Integrate key visualization**: `top5_coherent_constructs_tsne.png`
3. **Compile to APA format** using Quarto
4. **Prepare for submission**

### Manuscript Commands:
```bash
# Navigate to manuscript directory
cd manuscript/

# Update with current findings (manual editing needed)
open leadership_measurement_paper.qmd

# Compile to Word format for review
quarto render leadership_measurement_paper.qmd --to apaquarto-docx

# View compiled manuscript
open leadership_measurement_paper.docx
```

### Key Statistics to Include:
- Holdout validation: 87.4% vs 62.9% (24.5 percentage point difference)
- Effect sizes: Large (d=1.116) vs Small-Medium (d=0.368)  
- Statistical test: t(853.99) = 43.49, p < 2.22e-16
- Most coherent constructs comparison included in visualization

## ðŸ”„ SECONDARY: Repository Cleanup (Future)
1. Create `/archive` folder for old analyses
2. Move visualizations to `/results` or `/outputs`
3. Consolidate redundant scripts
4. Streamline directory structure

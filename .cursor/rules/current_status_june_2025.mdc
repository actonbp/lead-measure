# CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE (June 2, 2025)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION FOR AI AGENT

**PRIORITY**: Run Ivan's enhanced analysis on machine with sufficient GPU memory (16GB+ recommended)

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Step 1 COMPLETED**: Generated 41,723 randomized pairs (`data/processed/ipip_pairs_randomized.jsonl`)
- ‚ùå **Step 2 FAILED**: Training stopped due to GPU memory limitations on current machine
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **READY TO CONTINUE**: All setup complete, just need bigger GPU

### Commands to Execute:

**Option A - Step by Step (RECOMMENDED):**
```bash
# 1. Check environment
source leadmeasure_env/bin/activate
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --check

# 2. Run the critical training step (the one that failed)
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 2

# 3. Complete analysis
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 3
python scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py --step 4
```

**Option B - Make Commands:**
```bash
make ivan-check
make ivan-step2    # The critical step that failed
make ivan-step3
make ivan-step4
```

**Option C - Complete Workflow:**
```bash
./scripts/run_ivan_analysis.sh
```

### Expected Results:
- **99.43%** probability of correct same-construct ranking (vs 81.66% baseline)
- **Cohen's d = 2.487** (massive effect size)
- Clear t-SNE visualizations showing construct separation

### Key Files Ready:
- `scripts/ivan_analysis/` - Complete implementation ready to run
- `scripts/ivan_analysis/SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `scripts/ivan_analysis/run_analysis_steps.py` - Step-by-step runner with validation
- `Makefile` - Simple commands for execution

### Hardware Requirements:
- 16GB+ GPU memory for full batch sizes (96)
- Or modify `scripts/ivan_analysis/train_with_tsdae.py` to reduce batch sizes further
